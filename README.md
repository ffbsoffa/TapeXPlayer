# TapeXPlayer

TapeXPlayer is an open-source digital media player based on FFmpeg, designed to recreate the tactile experience of using vintage video tape players, reminiscent of those once popular in television editing studios. Inspired by the Scrub/Shuttle functionality found in Pro Tools, TapeXPlayer offers precise control over media playback, allowing users to scrub and shuttle through audio and video with the same intuitive feel of traditional tape editing systems.

This program is open-source, meaning youâ€™re welcome to modify and extend it according to your needs. One of its standout features is the integration with external playback controllers, primarily in the MIDI format, such as the Behringer X-Touch One, providing a seamless and hands-on editing experience.
